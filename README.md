# Quantum Random Key Generator

A **Quantum Random Key Generator** built using quantum computing principles. This project generates highly secure and truly random cryptographic keys, ideal for encryption and secure communications.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Generates **quantum-based random keys**.
- Supports keys of customizable **lengths**.
- Easy to use and integrate into cryptographic applications.
- Provides a **secure and reliable source of randomness**.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suv4tha/QuantumRandomKeyGenerator.git
````

2. **Navigate to the project folder**

```bash
cd QuantumRandomKeyGenerator
```

3. **Install dependencies** (if any, e.g., Python packages)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the main script (e.g., `main.py`) in your preferred IDE or terminal.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Enter the desired key length when prompted.
4. The quantum random key will be displayed/generated.
