# QuantumRandomKeyGenerator
This project simulates a Quantum Random Key Generator (QRKG) using Python and Qiskit. It utilizes the Hadamard gate to generate true randomness from quantum superposition. The simulator measures a single qubit multiple times, converts the outcomes into a cryptographic key, and visualizes the randomness
